# Sheet SPA

The Sheet widget is to allow a Google Sheets users to view their sheets.
When first using the widget, the user interface displays a login screen; following the initial login/authentication step, the users are given a form to fill out to specify which spreadsheet they wish to view and the specific sheet's name. Once viewing a sheet, the user can also pick from a list the other sheets in that spreadsheet. Users can also return to the form to load a different sheet.
